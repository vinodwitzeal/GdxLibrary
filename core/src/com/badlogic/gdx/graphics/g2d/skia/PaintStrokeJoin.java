 * <p>Join specifies how corners are drawn when a shape is stroked. Join

 * stroked path.</p>
 *
 * <p>Choose miter join to draw sharp corners. Choose round join to draw a circle with a
 * radius equal to the stroke width on top of the corner. Choose bevel join to minimally
 * connect the thick strokes.</p>
 *
 * <p>The fill path constructed to describe the stroked path respects the join setting but may
 * not contain the actual join. For instance, a fill path constructed with round joins does
 * not necessarily include circles at each connected segment.</p>
